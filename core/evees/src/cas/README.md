# CAS Module

CAS stands for content addressable objects.

This module includes tools related to creating and manipulating these type of objects.

It includes, among others, the definition of the `Entity` type, the interface of a `CASStore` and a `CASRemote`, and an implementation of the `CASStore` in memory and locally.
